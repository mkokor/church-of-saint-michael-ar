  St. Michael's Church AR is an application created in Unity3D that recognizes the image of St. Michael's 
  Church and displays a 3D model of the church along with three additional objects: a Bible, a bell, and a statue of St. Michael. 
  Each of these additional objects offers users specific graphic or audio content when selected.
